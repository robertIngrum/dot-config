# .config

This repository is a centralized location with most of my important workspace configuration. This is a work in progress, so expect breaking changes often.

## Structure

The `./components` directory contains a series of sub-directories, each encapsulating a specific feature or program (i.e. NeoVim, iTerm, AeroSpace). These directories should contain a `README.md` with setup instructions, whether that means installing a program, symlinking a directory, etc.
